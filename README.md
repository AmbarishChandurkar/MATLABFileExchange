# MATLABFileExchange-

I am Ambarish Prashant Chandurkar, Bachelor of Technology ECE(2021) from IIIT Nagpur 
This repository contains Implementation MATLAB Algorithms for the course Numerical Methods (MAL - 201)

In this repository, I have implemented numerical methods like Newton - Raphson Method, General Iteration Method and others.

My aim is to make the code such that it can be used while learning course in order to understand concepts by visualisation
Feel free to suggest any changes to make the code more intuitive and easy to understand.
