"The Newton - Raphson Method" uses one initial approximation to solve a given equation y = f(x).In this method the function f(x) , is approximated by a tangent line, whose equation is found from the value of f(x) and its first derivative at the initial approximation.

The tangent line then intersects the X - Axis at second point. This second point is again used as next approximation to find the third point.

The script proceeds in the same way and performs upto 100 iterations. The Accuracy required (required no. of decimal places) is taken as input from the user. The error between solutions of each iteration is checked everytime and if found less than required accuracy, the iterations are stopped.
